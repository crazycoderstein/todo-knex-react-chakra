# WeatherWorks Full-stack JS Coding Challenge

## To-do list exercise

In this repo, It's function is to implement to-do list application with React (in TypeScript) that talks to a RESTful API.

This repo contains two codebases: [web](https://bitbucket.org/weatherworks/fullstack-challenge/src/master/web) contains a React app that is powered by a REST API in the [api](https://bitbucket.org/weatherworks/fullstack-challenge/src/master/api) directory. The API uses [Knex](https://knexjs.org/) to talk to a SQLite database.

## Functions

- The ability to add a to-do item to the list
- The ability to edit a to-do item that's already within the list
- The ability to mark a to-do item as complete
- The ability to reorder the to-do items within the list Utilize for UI components

## Environment Setup

1. Install Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Install deps by running `npm run deps`
3. Start the app with `npm start`

###

If all went well, you should be able to access the app at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
